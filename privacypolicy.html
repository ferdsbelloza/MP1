    <h2><b><u>Privacy & Confidentiality of Library Records</u></b></h2>
            <h3>Approved June 23, 2020</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Silent Library (the “Library”) is committed to protecting the privacy of all library patrons, other users and donors (collectively, “users”). This commitment is based on applicable law and on the ethics and practices of librarianship. In relevant part, Narwarts law (General Statutes of Hognia, Chapter 190, Section 11-25) provides that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[R]ecords maintained by libraries that can be used to identify any library user, or link any user to a library transaction, regardless of format, shall be kept confidential, except that the records may be disclosed to officers, employees, and agents of the library, as necessary for the operation of the library.</li>
                <li>Information contained in such records shall not be released to any third party, except (A) pursuant to a court order, or (B) with the written permission of the library user whose personal information is contained in the records.</li>
                <li>No provision of this [law] shall be construed to prevent a library from publishing or making available to the public statistical reports regarding library registration and use of library materials if such reports do not contain personally-identifying information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In furtherance of the LibraryU+0060s commitment to privacy and confidentiality, it aims to collect and use information from and about its users only as required for proper operation of the Library and in order to deliver Library services to users. In addition, the Library only retains such information in accordance with the Library’s guidelines for so long as needed to satisfy the intended use of such information. Any Library record or other information collected by the Library is only subject to disclosure pursuant to a court order or as otherwise authorized by applicable law.
                <br>
                <br>This Policy explains what information the Library collects from or about users and how that information is used and shared. 
                <br>
                <br>By visiting a Library location, using its services, using the Library website, downloading the Library’s mobile applications or content, or donating to the Library, users are deemed to have agreed to this Policy. The Library may update this Policy from time to time, and will notify users by posting the updated Policy to its website, by sending users an email or by some other means. Users also agree to let the Library use email and postal addresses to communicate about Library programs, services, events, fundraising efforts, and more.
